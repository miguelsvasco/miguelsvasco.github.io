Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> (Stockholm, Sweden), advised by <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/">Danica Kragic</a>. 

My long-term goal is to build multimodal artificial agents that naturally <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04809/">co-exist</a> with humans in real and virtual environments. To achieve this, I leverage reinforcement learning to design agents that act <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12563v1">effectively</a>, while adapting to changes in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03390">perception</a>, their <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=IxRf7Q3s5e">environment</a>, and <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1942924&dswid=1366">human preferences</a>. Additionally, my research explores the <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=3f8i9GlBzu">alignment</a> between human and artificial perception, investigating representations <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03081/">grounded</a> in human sensory experience.

I completed my Ph.D. at Instituto Superior Tecnico (Lisbon, Portugal), where my work on multimodal reinforcement learning was awarded the <a href="https://www.appia.pt/2024/10/07/vencedor-do-concurso-melhor-tese-de-doutoramento/">Best PhD Thesis in AI in Portugal</a>. Previously, I was an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2021/participants">RSS Pioneer</a> and a research intern at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out to discuss potential collaborations!

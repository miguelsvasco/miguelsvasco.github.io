Hi, I’m Miguel Vasco, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, advised by <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/">Danica Kragic</a>. My research focuses on advancing reinforcement learning to build intelligent virtual agents that can adapt and thrive in complex, uncertain environments. I’m particularly interested in how these agents can integrate diverse sensory inputs and reason across modalities to make informed and effective decisions.

During my Ph.D. at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Tecnico</a>, where I graduated summa cum laude, I explored multimodal representation learning to enhance agent perception and decision-making. This work earned me the Best PhD Thesis in AI in Portugal (2024). Since then, I’ve worked on projects that range from developing superhuman RL agents for autonomous systems, during my internship at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>, to creating hierarchical and generative models for cross-modal reasoning. Along the way, my contributions have been recognized with awards such as the Best Paper at the Reinforcement Learning Conference 2024. I am also the co-creator of the <a href="https://talking-robotics.github.io/">Talking Robotics</a> podcast, which provides a platform for young researchers to share their work and connect within the AI community.

Feel free to explore my work here or connect with me to discuss potential collaborations — I am currently on the job market for industry positions.

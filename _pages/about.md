Hi, I’m Miguel Vasco, a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, advised by <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/">Danica Kragic</a>. I’m broadly interested in building multimodal artificial agents that can co-exist with humans.  My work explores how reinforcement learning can be used to develop multimodal agents that act effectively across diverse tasks, while remaining robust to environmental changes and adaptable to human preferences. I’m also interested in the alignment between human and machine perception, studying how artificial systems can learn multimodal representations grounded in human sensory processing.

I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Tecnico</a>, where my work on multimodal reinforcement learning was honored with the <a href="https://www.appia.pt/2024/10/07/vencedor-do-concurso-melhor-tese-de-doutoramento/">Best PhD Thesis in AI in Portugal</a>. I also interned at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>, where I developed superhuman multimodal RL agents.

Feel free to explore my work here or connect with me to discuss potential collaborations — I am currently on the job market for industry positions.

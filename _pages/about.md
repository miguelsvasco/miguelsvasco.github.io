Hi, I’m Miguel Vasco, a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, advised by <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/">Danica Kragic</a>. 

My long-term goal is to build artificial agents that can **co-exist** with human in real and virtual environments. My research explores how reinforcement learning can be used to develop multimodal agents that act <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12563v1">effectively</a>, while remaining <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03390">robust</a> to changes in the environment and <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1942924&dswid=1366">adaptable</a> to human preferences. I also focus on the <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=3f8i9GlBzu">alignment</a> between human and machine perception, studying how to learn multimodal representations <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03081/">grounded</a> in human sensory processing.

I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Tecnico</a>, where my work on multimodal reinforcement learning was honored with the <a href="https://www.appia.pt/2024/10/07/vencedor-do-concurso-melhor-tese-de-doutoramento/">Best PhD Thesis in AI in Portugal</a>. I also interned at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>, where I developed superhuman multimodal RL agents.

Feel free to explore my work here or connect with me to discuss potential collaborations — I am currently on the job market for industry positions.

Hi, I’m Miguel Vasco, a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, advised by <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/">Danica Kragic</a>. My research focuses on building reinforcement learning agents that act in complex environments by integrating diverse sensory inputs and reasoning across modalities. I am also interested in how images, text, and brain signals align with human perception, exploring how artificial models can learn multimodal representations grounded in human sensory processing.

I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Tecnico</a>, where my work on multimodal reinforcement learning was honored with the Best PhD Thesis in AI in Portugal (2024). I also interned at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>, where I developed superhuman multimodal RL agents.

Feel free to explore my work here or connect with me to discuss potential collaborations — I am currently on the job market for industry positions.

Hi, I’m Miguel Vasco, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, advised by <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/">Danica Kragic</a>. My research focuses on advancing reinforcement learning to build intelligent virtual agents that adapt and thrive in complex, uncertain environments by integrating diverse sensory inputs and reasoning across modalities.

I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Tecnico</a>, where my work on multimodal representation and reinforcement learning was honored with the Best PhD Thesis in AI in Portugal (2024). I also interned at Sony AI, where I developed superhuman RL agents — a project that received the Best Paper award at the Reinforcement Learning Conference 2024.

Feel free to explore my work here or connect with me to discuss potential collaborations — I am currently on the job market for industry positions.
